# SingleTake Cleaner

## Description

- Move all matching files to a trash folder (DCIM/Camera/SingleTake_Trash).
- **Simulation (dry run) mode** to preview which files will be moved.
- Test button to move a single file to trash for verification.
- Modern Android permissions handling.

## Motivation

  This project was built for my dad, who has a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and loves taking photos with it. He records every special moment in life to cherish them and to help him remember everything in the future. Little did he know, the "Single Take" recording mode automatically generates several images and videos from each original video, adding new background music and transitions. He soon ran out of storage due to the huge number of similar videos and images. When he realized what had happened, he was worried about the complexity of deleting them one by one. As a CSIE student, I decided to solve this problem for him!
